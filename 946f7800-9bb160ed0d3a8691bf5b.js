I believe victims have to be ready to realise and have assurance of security and wellbeing, if they choose to take action against abuse or violence from their partners.\nKey Takeaway: Realise that your friend/family member has to be willing to help themselves first, for a breakthrough to take place, patience is key.'},{type:s.TITLE,title:"Helping a friend"},{type:s.TEXT,text:"\"My friend was in a relationship with a controlling guy for about a year. All seemed normal throughout the relationship in my outsider's eyes and she didn't really notice any 'warning signs' as they were very much in love with each other. After a year, I had a chat with her as he was behaving shitty towards her - it was never his fault and he would always blame her for things; even going quiet for a couple of days and making her feel bad. She talked me through certain situations during their relationship when he had been really controlling and manipulative. She said she feels stupid for never recognising these signs. She was scared of meeting him to break up with him - as she didn't know how he'd react. We made a plan together and I supported her and was available to chat with her all the time. She met him in a public place, set her agenda, broke up with him, and I advised her to secretly record the chat (just in case). Then I helped move her things from his flat - this way, she didn't have to see him.\"\nKey Takeaway: It takes time - you can point to all the resources and tips/tricks you want, but don't be pushy.

They can be scared of being judged and accused of lying. They might feel forced into having to prove to others that they are in fact telling the truth or even embarrassed or ashamed to be in an abusive relationship.\nThere are many forms of abuse (physical, verbal, psychological, emotional, sexual) and when someone is living through it, it is not always easy to recognise abuse for what it is. The first step to someone leaving a violent or abusive relationship is to be able to acknowledge it. Speaking about what they are going through, even if it confuses them, is one way to share their feelings that things aren’t going well or as they should. How a friend listens to these stories is of key importance."},{type:s.TITLE,title:"Tips"},{type:s.LIST,intro:"Listen patiently. Do not interrupt or force your own opinions on your friend. It is normal to have an urge to do so because you want to get them out of this situation as quickly as possible. Yet, you risk shutting them down and stopping them from speaking to you openly in the future.",list:["Wait and respect the time they take to tell you their story. Your friend may not be ready to tell you everything that has happened to them in the first sitting.","Be sensitive to the surroundings in which you meet and talk. Try to meet in a quiet place which is neutral enough to help them talk about such difficult issues. Your friend may not want to talk about it in public, so perhaps go for a walk or do an activity - like cooking together. It is sometimes easier to talk when you are not just staring at one another across a table.","Do not judge. Your opinion is important but you shouldn’t make your friend feel judged. Try to maintain a conversation that allows them to speak freely. Ask open-ended questions that encourage them to elaborate on their situation and describe their experiences. For example, you can simply ask “How are you?” or “I’d love to hear what is going on. Would you like to share with me?”. You can also mirror back what they are saying, using phrases such as “It sounds like you are…” or “From what I understand you are saying that…” You may also try to avoid questions that require your friend to justify their experiences, such as those that start with “why…?”.","Listen and be careful about what you say. Remember that your friend may have positive feelings such as love for their abuser. Attacking their abuser may cause your friend to become defensive and/or shut down.","Try to work out if your friend is in danger. Listen carefully and sensitively to what your friend is telling you. Try to assess carefully if they are in danger, but make sure not to scare or panic them. You will find sources at the end of this guide presenting the signs you should look out for.","Speak to your friend regularly. Do not let too much time pass between the occasions that you speak to your friend about their situation. Try to do this without being intrusive, and instead aim to create a safe space where they can speak to you in confidence.","Recommend your friend to speak to other people, but only if it is safe to do so. It is really important that in order to prevent increasing risk, they only tell sensitive information to people they know they can trust, especially if the individuals they are unsure about are connected to their abuser or the abuser’s family. One way of testing people is to entrust them with a small, innocent secret and wait to see if they break your friend’s trust. If they do, your friend will know not to trust them. If their family, friends and co-workers are supportive, then you can encourage your friend to build a network of trust. This will help them to get the support and protection they might need.","Speak to someone. Once your friend has confided in you about their situation you will need support too. While you are helping your friend through this difficult situation, it's important to take care of your own mental health in the process. You may feel frustrated and powerless if you try to resolve the situation alone.","Choose carefully who you speak to. Speak to someone who you can trust and who may help you to understand how to go forward. Make sure not to speak to someone who is also close to your friend in need, or someone who they may not want to confide in.","Do not speak about the situation to your friend’s partner. You cannot resolve the situation by mediating between your friend and their partner. You must not tell their partner what they have told you. Doing so can endanger your friend and may make their situation more difficult. Above all, you are likely to lose your friend’s trust.","Remember that you can seek professional support. It can be very emotionally difficult to support a friend in a violent relationship. If the situation continues, remember that it is not your fault. There are a variety of professional support networks to protect people in violent relationships. You can contact them for advice and to talk about your feelings. They are available for people in both homo- and heterosexual relationships. We are aware that these support structures might not exist or might be difficult to access from where you live and that this is a hard situation to be in. In this case, there might be other resources you can access over the internet, like online counseling or chat rooms.

You are not in the relationship and hence, cannot control what happens. This can be frustrating and can make you feel like you are not doing anything to help. Try to remember that just listening and supporting your friend is one of the most important things you can do to make them feel stronger."},{type:s.TITLE,title:"Tips"},{type:s.LIST,list:["Let them know they are not alone! Although it is clearly not acceptable that this is happening, there are many people who have experienced similar situations and have made it through.","Do not put your friend down. Remember that abuse against women cuts across socio-economic and political groups. We are all exposed to it.","Remember that each case is unique, even if there are similar patterns of abuse in many abusive relationships. There are no universal answers or ways out of violent and abusive relationships. Respect each individual case for what it is. Don’t compare your friend’s situation with a different one that might trivialise their incident or make them feel as if they weren’t taken seriously.","Make it clear you believe them. Never doubt that your friend is telling you the truth or they may not be able to confide in you. Remember that it is a huge step to tell someone that your partner is violent or abusive. You must trust your friend so they can trust you.","Be careful not to sound judgemental when expressing your opinion. For example, do not say “I would never have expected that you would let something like this happen to you!”","Do not assume that the violence and abuse is mutual. This assumption is made particularly often for same-sex relationships because it is sometimes believed that a closer similarity in physical strength will mean that mutual abuse is more likely. This is, of courses, incorrect logic. Be aware of any subconscious assumptions you make so that you are able to catch yourself out. Believe what your friend tells you and do not assume to know better. People who are suffering abuse at the hands of a partner tend to blame and belittle themselves. If you express doubts, then you are not helping them.","Remember you cannot get your friend out of this situation alone. The person who is in the abusive relationship must be free to leave in their own way and time. You may become frustrated if they stay in the relationship. Even if they keep putting themselves in that situation, do not blame them and do not try to force a quick solution. Respect your friend and the time they need. Do not try to solve the situation yourself, only your friend can choose to do that. The most important thing is remaining open and available to talk to.","Do not blame yourself if your friend stays in the relationship. It is difficult to leave an abusive relationship and it may take a lot of time. Continue to support them and provide a safe space where they can speak to you in confidence. Providing trust and support is essential to help them have some relief and eventually break free.","Try to focus the discussion on how your friend feels. Often people who experience abuse at the hands of a partner are blamed for the situation and their feelings can be dismissed. Help them explore their feelings and understand that they are not wrong or at fault.","Help them to clarify and interpret what has happened. Get your friend to speak to you about the times when their partner was violent or abusive. Ask them to speak about when they were controlling or coercive. Help them separate fact from feeling. Too often, the words ‘love’ and ‘passion’ are used to justify any kind of behaviour.","Ask your friend how you can help them. Your friend might know what they need your help with. Don’t make assumptions about their needs, ask first.","Try to help them explore the imbalance of power that characterises abusive relationships. Does your friend often make compromises to please their partner? Is their partner condescending? Is your friend changing their behaviour to please their partner? Are they avoiding friends in order to make their partner feel better? Help them understand and realise that they will never be able to make their abusive partner happy but instead will end up abandoning their own identity. Biderman’s Chart of Coercion is an example of a useful tool to identify abuse. It can also be particularly difficult for people who identify as LGBTQIA+ to identify abuse within their relationships because abuse in these relationships often do not follow the narrative we so often hear about abuse. The Supernova Project outlines what abuse can look like within LGBTQIA+ relationships, which can be a useful tool to identify abuse","Do not legitimise the violence and abuse. Although you should be careful not to scare them, you should recognise and name violence and abuse for what they are. No emotion can ever justify violence or abuse.","Make it clear that substance dependency is not an excuse. The use and abuse of drugs, alcohol and pharmaceuticals is not an excuse for violence or abuse in any situation.","Nothing is an excuse for violent behaviour! Even though it might explain the behaviour somehow, the abuser’s traumatic past or challenging circumstances are never a justification for abuse and violence.","Highlight your friend’s strengths and the possibilities open to them. Often people who suffer violence and abuse feel powerless and overwhelmed by the situation. Outside help can make them feel less alone and realise that they are far from being useless, even if their abuser might have made them feel this way. Help them understand that they can take back control of the situation and that they can determine their own life’s path. If they feel nervous that they do not have enough evidence of the abuse itself to convince family and/or authorities, you can go through our ‘How to build your own domestic violence case without a lawyer’ which provides tips and templates on how to collect and display evidence.","If you think it could help, take them to a women’s refuge or drop-in centre or the house of someone where they feel safe.","Help your friend find alternative accommodation, particularly if they need to get away from their partner or if you think that they are in immediate danger.","If you think it could help, and you feel comfortable doing so, speak to your friend about your own experiences of violent or abusive relationships. It could help them feel less inadequate and embarrassed. Gender-based and same-sex violence are a collective problem. Recognising them, sharing stories and supporting each other are essential in the fight against them."]},{type:s.TITLE,title:"If they have children"},{type:s.LIST,list:["Without making them feel like a ‘bad parent’, remind them that a violent parent harms the welfare of children. If your friend has children, then it is a lot harder to end an abusive relationship and contact with that person. Often children are used as ‘blackmail’ by the abuser in order to control their partner, even after a relationship has ended.","Even when your friend’s partner doesn’t harm the children, they will still be affected by living in a violent home. There is a very fine line to tread between not making your friend feel guilty and keeping them aware of the harmful effects on children of being in a violent home. When children are involved, it is even more important for you to help your friend get out of the violent relationship. Help them understand that leaving a violent partner does not deprive children of a parent. Instead, it saves them from living in a climate of fear and anxiety.","If the child of a friend speaks up about violence and abuse at home, they are unlikely to be lying.

We need to be a strong support network for a friend suffering from abuse. Therefore, it is essential to understand the many factors that pull people back to a relationship that is physically or psychologically harmful:\n\nLove – this factor may be extremely difficult for friends and family to understand. How can someone still love a partner who is abusive? The fact is that abuse rarely starts at the beginning of a relationship. Your friend will have gone through what’s called a ‘honeymoon period’ where the abuser was charming, attentive and loving. This period may repeat itself during the relationship, in between experiences of abuse. Once someone is in love, it is hard to break that bond. This is especially true when the abuser is a parent of their children.\n\nChildren – survivors of abuse are often convinced by their abusive partner that they are worthless and a bad parent. They will constantly be told that if they leave, they will never see their children again. Although this may not be true, abusers can manipulate your friend emotionally and mentally until they believe everything they say. Also, many people believe that they should keep the family together. They may also believe it is the best thing to avoid children growing up with just one parent, having to move schools and often move far from where they live.\n\nFinance – survivors of abuse will often be denied access to bank accounts and they are often manipulated into leaving work. This means that once they are out of the relationship they have no financial stability. This can cause people to return to their abusive partner because it is better than being homeless – again this is particularly difficult when children are involved.\n\nMental health issues – the trauma of physical and/or mental abuse could cause your friend mental health problems such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression. Your friend’s abusive partner may have used this to manipulate them. For example, they may deny them essential medication or make your friend dependent on their support."},{type:s.TITLE,title:"What can you do?"},{type:s.TEXT,text:'You might hope that you can be a "fixer", by showing care and support, but the truth of the matter is abusive relationships are highly complex.

They are listened to and protected so that they can recognise and understand the violence that they have experienced. A women’s refuge aims to create a space where women can realise their aspirations and potential away from heavy societal pressures. It helps women to start on the path to escaping violence and abuse.\n\nSafe Space: A place where someone can relax and be themselves freely without running the risk of feeling uncomfortable, judged or insecure. It is safe for those that use it regardless of their heritage, nationality, social class, gender identity, sexual orientation, cultural background, religious belief, age, and mental or physical condition. What feels safe to people will depend on their background and experiences and those that need support should be consulted to make sure it feels safe to them.\n\nSpiral of violence: All the ways in which a person can undermine their partner, such as making them feel weak, helpless and dependant on them, and how these experiences combine and enhance each other. There are seven stages in this cyclical process: intimidation, isolation, devaluation, segregation, physical and sexual aggression, using children as blackmail. These stages may happen in different orders and at different speeds. There may often be periods of relative calm between each stage, aiming to weaken the survivors and further isolate them. You will find more information about this at the end of this guide.\n\nGender-based violence: According to the United Nations, any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or limiting of freedom, whether occurring in public or in private life. It can be short or long term, and can extend to physical, psychological, emotional, existential and material damage. Violence cannot be associated exclusively with certain social, economic, cultural, national or religious conditions, but is a phenomenon that cuts across society. It may occur and be cultivated in a variety of environments. Gender-based violence often entails the abuse of the woman’s trust, in environments such as a romantic/intimate relationship, or in the workplace.\n\nSame-sex violence: Violence occurring within a relationship between two men or two women. This sort of violence is often ‘invisible’ due to society’s reluctance to accept such relationships and love. In addition, the need to continually defend one’s relationships from bigotry, homophobia, lesbophobia, transphobia and sexism further restricts one’s ability to speak openly about intimate partner violence, due to fear of being attacked once again for one’s sexual orientation and choices. The spiral of violence is a process which is internalised through systems of power and occurs regardless of gender. Those suffering the effects of violence do so, despite their sexuality. An individual who faces violence in a lesbian relationship undergoes violence threefold: in the relationship itself; in a lesbophobic and a sexist culture that both desires and rejects them; and through societal refusal to recognise the existence of violence in a relationship between women. It is everyone’s responsibility to recognise that same-sex violence exists, and to fight against it!"},{type:s.TITLE,title:"Useful links"},{type:s.TEXT,text:"What is domestic violence and how to identify it:\n\nhttp://chaynpakistan.org/am-i-being-abused/what-is-domestic-violence/​\n\nAbuse in queer relationships\n\n​http://supernovaproject.org/index.php/queer-abuse/​\n\nOne Love - defining relationship violence:\n\nA Quick summary of 1O important signs of abusive behaviour:\n\n​http://www.joinonelove.org/define_10_signs​\n\nHow to identify child abuse and neglect:\n\nGuidance from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in the UK:\n\n​https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/signs-symptoms-effects/​\n\nHow to identify manipulative situations and people, & how to deal with them:Crowdsourced by survivors\n\n​https://chayn.gitbooks.io/manipulation-is-abuse/content/​\n\nInformation about exiting abusive relationships:\n\nHelp your friend find resources to get out of the relationship\n\nOnline counselling and chatroom for emotional support provided by non-professionals\n\n​http://www.7cups.com/​\n\nHow to stay safe when online: DIY Online Privacy Guide - Basic\n\n​https://chayn.gitbooks.io/basic-diy-online-privacy/content/en/​\n\nHow to stay safe when online: DIY Online Privacy Guide - Advanced\n\n​https://chayn.gitbooks.io/advanced-diy-privacy-for-every-woman/content/securing-your-connections.html​\n\nHow To Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without A Lawyer\n\n​https://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/​"},{type:s.TITLE,title:"Many Thanks to Cagne Sciolte"},{type:s.TEXT,text:"This guide came about through a series of collective discussions in the ‘Cagne Sciolte’, a social centre in Rome, Italy, which runs a research centre against gender-based and same-sex violence.
